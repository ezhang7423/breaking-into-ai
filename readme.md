# ML Resources
Trying to find the fastest way to get into deep learning, while still understanding the concepts at a low level. Will update this page with progress and with what worked vs. what didn't

Assumed prerequisites:
* Multivariable Calculus
* Linear Algebra

------

Current plan is to work through three concurrent paths:
<ol>
<li>Guided: <span>Aurelion Geron "Hands on with machine learning" or Francois Chollet "Deep learning with Python"</span>-><span>Hugo Larochelle's course</span>-><span>Stanford CS231N Winter</span></li>
Motivation: Starting with a simpler book that gets your hands dirty right away and excited to work with the topics is great. Not having to worry too much about the underlying concepts and just doing stuff is the best way to get started. Then, moving to a more advanced video course that explores the 
<li>Individual Experiments: </li>
<li>Underlying concepts: </li>
